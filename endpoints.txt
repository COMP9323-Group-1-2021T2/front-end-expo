Adam El Mohamad here's the mock endpoints I created for you to consume when building the FE:
 
BaseURL: https://87xldh7105.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/staging
GetCategories: https://87xldh7105.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/staging/categories
GetCategoryInfo: https://87xldh7105.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/staging/ohs/machinery
GetCategoryArticles: https://87xldh7105.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/staging/ohs/machinery/articles
GetCategoryVideos: https://87xldh7105.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/staging/ohs/machinery/videos
 
From the example ohs = parent category, machinery = sub category
